Using `strace` can be extremely powerful for tracing system calls and signals on Linux. Here are some examples ranging from basic to advanced levels:

### Basic Examples:

1. **Trace a running process by PID:**
   ```bash
   strace -p <pid>
   ```
   Replace `<pid>` with the process ID of the running process you want to trace.

2. **Trace a command from start:**
   ```bash
   strace command
   ```
   Replace `command` with the actual command you want to trace.

3. **Log all system calls to a file:**
   ```bash
   strace -o output.txt command
   ```
   This logs all output to `output.txt`.

### Intermediate Examples:

4. **Trace child processes (`-f` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -f -o output.txt command
   ```
   This traces the specified command and any child processes it spawns, logging to `output.txt`.

5. **Trace only a specific set of system calls:**
   ```bash
   strace -e trace=open,read,write command
   ```
   This traces only the `open`, `read`, and `write` system calls made by `command`.

6. **Display time spent in each system call (`-T` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -T command
   ```
   This shows the time spent in each system call.

### Advanced Examples:

7. **Trace system calls recursively (`-ff` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -ff -o output.txt command
   ```
   This traces the specified command and its children, creating separate output files for each process.

8. **Attach to a running process and trace (`-p` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -p <pid> -o output.txt
   ```
   Attach to an already running process specified by `<pid>` and log all output to `output.txt`.

9. **Trace signals in addition to system calls (`-e` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -e trace=all -e verbose=none command
   ```
   This traces all system calls and signals generated by `command`.

### Super Advanced Examples:

10. **Trace system calls and resolve memory addresses (`-v` option):**
    ```bash
    strace -v -o output.txt command
    ```
    This provides verbose output, including the memory addresses involved in system calls.

11. **Trace using a custom filter expression (`-e` option):**
    ```bash
    strace -e 'trace=!all' command
    ```
    This traces all system calls except those listed in the filter expression.

12. **Trace system calls and include timestamps (`-t` option):**
    ```bash
    strace -t -o output.txt command
    ```
    This adds timestamps to each line of output in `output.txt`.

These examples should cover a wide range of scenarios from basic tracing of a single process to more complex scenarios involving child processes, specific system calls, signals, and detailed output options. Adjust the options based on your specific needs and the complexity of the tracing task at hand.
