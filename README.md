Using `strace` can be extremely powerful for tracing system calls and signals on Linux. Here are some examples ranging from basic to advanced levels:

### Basic Examples:

1. **Trace a running process by PID:**
   ```bash
   strace -p <pid>
   ```
   Replace `<pid>` with the process ID of the running process you want to trace.

2. **Trace a command from start:**
   ```bash
   strace command
   ```
   Replace `command` with the actual command you want to trace.

3. **Log all system calls to a file:**
   ```bash
   strace -o output.txt command
   ```
   This logs all output to `output.txt`.

### Intermediate Examples:

4. **Trace child processes (`-f` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -f -o output.txt command
   ```
   This traces the specified command and any child processes it spawns, logging to `output.txt`.

5. **Trace only a specific set of system calls:**
   ```bash
   strace -e trace=open,read,write command
   ```
   This traces only the `open`, `read`, and `write` system calls made by `command`.

6. **Display time spent in each system call (`-T` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -T command
   ```
   This shows the time spent in each system call.

### Advanced Examples:

7. **Trace system calls recursively (`-ff` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -ff -o output.txt command
   ```
   This traces the specified command and its children, creating separate output files for each process.

8. **Attach to a running process and trace (`-p` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -p <pid> -o output.txt
   ```
   Attach to an already running process specified by `<pid>` and log all output to `output.txt`.

9. **Trace signals in addition to system calls (`-e` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -e trace=all -e verbose=none command
   ```
   This traces all system calls and signals generated by `command`.

### Super Advanced Examples:

10. **Trace system calls and resolve memory addresses (`-v` option):**
    ```bash
    strace -v -o output.txt command
    ```
    This provides verbose output, including the memory addresses involved in system calls.

11. **Trace using a custom filter expression (`-e` option):**
    ```bash
    strace -e 'trace=!all' command
    ```
    This traces all system calls except those listed in the filter expression.

12. **Trace system calls and include timestamps (`-t` option):**
    ```bash
    strace -t -o output.txt command
    ```
    This adds timestamps to each line of output in `output.txt`.

These examples should cover a wide range of scenarios from basic tracing of a single process to more complex scenarios involving child processes, specific system calls, signals, and detailed output options. Adjust the options based on your specific needs and the complexity of the tracing task at hand.


Certainly! Let's explore some more advanced `strace` commands with practical examples:

### More Useful and Advanced `strace` Commands:

1. **Trace only successful system calls (`-z success` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -e trace=open,read,write -z success command
   ```
   This traces only successful `open`, `read`, and `write` system calls made by `command`.

2. **Display relative timestamps (`-r` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -r command
   ```
   This shows relative timestamps for each system call relative to the start of `command`.

3. **Display statistics at the end (`-c` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -c command
   ```
   This displays a summary of time and call counts for each system call made by `command` upon completion.

4. **Trace specific file accesses (using file descriptor):**
   ```bash
   strace -e trace=desc -e verbose=file command
   ```
   This traces all file descriptor operations (`desc`) and provides verbose information on file accesses.

5. **Trace only specific process threads (`-p PID -f` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -fp <pid> command
   ```
   This traces only the main thread of the process specified by `<pid>`, along with any child threads (`-f` option).

6. **Filter output by process ID (`-e trace=process` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -e trace=process command
   ```
   This traces process-related events such as `fork`, `execve`, and `exit`.

7. **Trace across a time range (`-t -T -r` options):**
   ```bash
   strace -t -T -r -o output.txt command
   ```
   This combines options to trace with timestamps (`-t`), time spent in each call (`-T`), relative timestamps (`-r`), and outputs to `output.txt`.

8. **Trace system calls made by a specific user (`-u username` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -u username command
   ```
   This traces system calls made by a specific user.

9. **Trace and output in hexadecimal format (`-xx` option):**
   ```bash
   strace -xx -o output.txt command
   ```
   This outputs all data in hexadecimal format in `output.txt`.

10. **Trace and follow forks and threads (`-ff` option):**
    ```bash
    strace -ff -o output.txt command
    ```
    This traces a process and all its children and threads, saving output to `output.txt`.

11. **Trace network related system calls (`-e trace=network` option):**
    ```bash
    strace -e trace=network command
    ```
    This traces network-related system calls such as `socket`, `connect`, `send`, and `recv`.

12. **Trace signals and their actions (`-e trace=signal` option):**
    ```bash
    strace -e trace=signal command
    ```
    This traces signals and their actions like `kill`, `sigaction`, and `sigprocmask`.

These advanced `strace` commands provide deeper insight into system behavior, allowing for detailed analysis of system calls, signals, file accesses, and more. Choose and adapt these commands based on your specific debugging or analysis requirements.
